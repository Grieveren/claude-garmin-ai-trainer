## Feature Prioritization Framework

### Prioritization Criteria

Features are evaluated using **RICE scoring** (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort):

- **Reach:** How many users benefit? (1-10 scale)
- **Impact:** How much does it improve user outcomes? (0.25-3x multiplier)
- **Confidence:** How certain are we? (0-100%)
- **Effort:** Development time in person-weeks (1-10)

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

| **Timeline Slips** | Medium | Medium | MEDIUM | Focus on MVP, defer non-critical features |

### Risk 1: Garmin API Instability

**Description:** The `garminconnect` library is unofficial and reverse-engineered. Garmin could change their API at any time, breaking data sync.

**Likelihood:** High (60%)
**Impact:** High (blocks core functionality)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Fallback Mechanism** (Phase 2 - Day 10)
   - Implement manual FIT file import feature
   - User can export FIT files from Garmin Connect
   - System parses FIT files and imports data
   - Documentation: "If sync fails, use manual import"

2. **Mock Garmin Service** (Phase 2 - Complete)
   - All development uses MockGarminConnect
   - System works even if real API is down
   - Can demo system without Garmin account

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Track Garmin sync success rate
   - Alert if success rate drops below 90%
   - Monitor `garminconnect` GitHub for issues

4. **Alternative Data Sources** (Future)
   - Apple HealthKit integration (iOS only)
   - Strava API integration
   - Manual data entry as last resort

**Contingency Plan:**
- If Garmin API breaks completely, pivot to manual FIT import
- Communicate clearly to users about workaround
- Fast-follow with alternative API integration

### Risk 2: AI Costs Exceed Budget

**Description:** Claude API costs could exceed target of $15/month per user if caching strategy fails or usage is higher than expected.

**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (economic model fails)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Aggressive Caching** (Phase 3 - Day 1)
   - Cache AI responses for 24 hours
   - In-memory LRU cache (last 100 requests)
   - Database cache (AIAnalysisCache table)
   - Target: >50% cache hit rate

2. **Token Usage Tracking** (Phase 3 - Day 1)
   - Log every API call with token counts
   - Dashboard showing monthly costs
   - Alert when monthly cost exceeds $10
   - User-facing cost transparency

3. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Use Claude's prompt caching feature
   - Minimize prompt size (remove redundant context)
   - Use shorter model (Haiku) for simple queries
   - Target: <1000 tokens per analysis

4. **Usage Throttling**
   - Limit manual analysis requests (max 5/day)
   - Daily automation runs once per day
   - Prevent abuse through rate limiting

**Cost Monitoring:**
- Daily cost reports
- Weekly cost projections
- Monthly budget alerts
- Per-user cost tracking

**Contingency Plan:**
- If costs exceed $15/month, reduce analysis frequency
- Option: User pays for premium features
- Option: Transition to smaller model or rule-based fallback

### Risk 3: AI Recommendations Poor Quality

**Description:** Claude AI might generate recommendations that don't make sense or aren't helpful for training.

**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (users lose trust)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Extensive Scenario Testing** (Phase 3 - Day 4)
   - Test 20+ realistic scenarios
   - Well-rested athlete → expect high intensity
   - Poor sleep + low HRV → expect rest day
   - High ACWR → expect reduced load
   - Collect 100+ test examples from real data

2. **Prompt Engineering** (Phase 3 - Day 1-2)
   - Detailed prompt with sports science context
   - Include example responses (few-shot learning)
   - Constrain output format with structured JSON
   - Iterate on prompt based on test results

3. **Human Review** (Pre-Launch)
   - Product manager reviews 50+ recommendations
   - Sports science expert validates logic
   - Real athlete tests system for 7 days
   - Collect qualitative feedback

4. **User Feedback Loop** (Post-Launch)
   - After each recommendation: "Was this helpful?" (Yes/No)
   - Free-text feedback option
   - Weekly review of feedback
   - Iterate on prompts based on user input

5. **Safety Constraints**
   - Never recommend high intensity if HRV <-15%
   - Never recommend hard workout if sleep <5 hours
   - Always provide alternative (easier option)
   - Include caveat: "Listen to your body"

**Quality Metrics:**
- >85% recommendations rated "helpful" or better
- <5% recommendations rated "not helpful"
- Recommendation acceptance rate >70%

**Contingency Plan:**
- If quality is poor, pivot to rule-based system temporarily
- Hire sports science consultant to refine prompts
- A/B test different prompt strategies

---

### Risk 4: User Adoption Low

**Description:** Users might not see enough value to use the system daily or might find it too complex.

**Likelihood:** Medium (35%)
**Impact:** High (product fails)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Clear Value Proposition**
   - Lead with benefits: "Prevent overtraining, maximize performance"
   - Show proof: "HRV drops 18% → System recommends rest → Avoid illness"
   - Use before/after: "With AI coach vs without"

2. **Smooth Onboarding** (Phase 5)
   - Setup wizard guides through Garmin connection
   - Backfill explains: "Analyzing 90 days of history..."
   - First recommendation highlights key features
   - Tutorial: "How to use your daily recommendation"

3. **Daily Habit Formation**
   - Morning notification creates routine
   - Dashboard is fast (<2s load)
   - Single clear action: "Today's workout"
   - Gamification: Streak counter "7 days in a row!"

4. **Early User Research** (Pre-Launch)
   - Beta test with 5-10 target users
   - Watch users interact with system (usability test)
   - Identify friction points and fix
   - Validate that users follow recommendations

5. **Educational Content**
   - Explain HRV, ACWR, training load concepts
   - Blog posts: "Why your HRV matters for training"
   - In-app tips: "Your ACWR is 1.3 - in the sweet spot!"

**Leading Indicators:**
- Setup completion rate >80%
- First week retention >85%
- Daily check-in rate >70%
- Recommendation follow-through >60%

**Contingency Plan:**
- If adoption is low, conduct user interviews
- Identify top friction points and address
- Simplify UI to single screen if needed
- Consider paid onboarding support
