## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Coordination (Prevent Phase 2 Integration Issues)

**Learnings from Phase 2:**
- Parallel development without coordination caused 96 test failures
- API mismatches required 2 days of rework
- Naming inconsistencies broke integration

**Solution:**
- **2-hour mandatory checkpoints** during parallel work (11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm)
- **API contracts frozen** before Phase 4 development starts
- **UI design frozen** before Phase 5 development starts
- **Integration tests** after every component completion
- **Daily integration validation** at end of each day

### 2. Quality Gates (No Phase Proceeds Without Passing)

Each phase has defined GO/NO-GO criteria that MUST be met:

**Phase 3:**
- 130+ tests passing
- Performance <500ms
- No critical bugs

**Phase 4:**
- All 45 endpoints functional
- Security audit passed
- Load testing: 100 concurrent users
- 130+ endpoint tests passing

**Phase 5:**
- All pages functional and responsive
- Lighthouse score ≥90
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- 50+ tests passing

**Phase 6:**
- Deployment successful
- Monitoring operational
- Security audit passed
- All smoke tests passing

**Rule:** If quality gate fails, phase must be completed before proceeding. Timeline adjusts.

### 3. Risk Management

**Top Risks:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration issues between phases | HIGH | 2-hour checkpoints, API contracts, incremental testing |
| Authentication vulnerabilities | CRITICAL | Security-first design, audit, penetration testing |
| API integration breaks frontend | HIGH | API version locking, contract testing, mocks |
| Deployment failures | HIGH | Staging environment, rollback plan, testing |
| Claude API costs exceed budget | MEDIUM | Aggressive caching, cost monitoring, alerts |

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Test Coverage Targets:**
- Phase 3: 130+ tests (unit, integration, scenario, performance)
- Phase 4: 130+ endpoint tests (API integration, security, load)
- Phase 5: 50+ frontend tests (component, integration, E2E)
- Overall: 310+ automated tests

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) where possible
- Integration tests after each component
- Continuous testing (run on every commit)
- Quality gate enforced (tests must pass)
