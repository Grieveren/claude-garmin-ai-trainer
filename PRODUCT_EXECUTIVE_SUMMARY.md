## Timeline to Launch

```
Week 3 (Current): Phase 3 - AI Analysis & Recommendations
Week 4:           Phase 4 - API Layer (parallel with Phase 3)
                  Phase 5 - Frontend UI
Week 5:           Phase 6 - Operations & Automation
                  Testing, Documentation, Beta Testing

LAUNCH: November 30, 2025 (4 weeks from today)
```

**Critical Path:**
- Phase 3 must complete before Phase 4 (API needs AI services)
- Phase 4 must complete before Phase 5 (UI needs API endpoints)
- Phase 6 can run parallel with Phase 5

**Confidence:** High - No major blockers identified, comprehensive planning complete
