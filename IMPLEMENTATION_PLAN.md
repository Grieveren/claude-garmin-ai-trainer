4. **Performance benchmark** entire system (all targets met)
5. **Security scan** complete system (no critical issues)
6. **Load test** system (stable under expected load)
7. **24-hour stability test** (no crashes, no memory leaks)

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk 1: Garmin API Breaks (HIGH PROBABILITY)
**Mitigation**:
- Implement FIT file manual import as fallback (Track 2A)
- Mock Garmin service for development (Track 2A)
- Monitor garminconnect library GitHub for updates
- Document manual export procedure
- Consider Apple HealthKit alternative (future)

### Risk 2: Claude AI Costs Exceed Budget
**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive prompt caching (Track 3A)
- Cache AI responses for 24 hours (Track 3A)
- Monitor token usage daily (Track 3A)
- Add cost alerts when approaching limits
- Option to reduce analysis frequency

### Risk 3: Development Timeline Slips
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on MVP first (Days 1-21)
- Defer non-critical features to Phase 2
- Weekly progress reviews
- Adjust parallelization if agents blocked

### Risk 4: AI Recommendations Not Sensible
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive testing with various scenarios (Track 3E)
- Human review of recommendations
- Adjustable AI temperature
- Override mechanism for user
- Collect feedback for prompt improvements

### Risk 5: Performance Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Performance testing early (Track 7B)
- Database indexing from start (Track 1A)
- Caching at multiple layers (Track 3A, Track 7B)
- Async operations where possible
- Profiling before optimization
